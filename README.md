# TileMaker
Easy tile creator for 2D games.

## How to use

Before you keep in mind what type of tile you want to create, you can create a list of block or wall tiles.

So for blocks, use a 48 x 56 image, and for walls 48 x 80.

![GrassTile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/880e7871-a6ff-49cb-872b-f287e7f5e357)

Within the image, use your preferred editor to create an 8 x 8 grid within the image. Each piece will be a part of the tile that will be used to create the different connection models.
